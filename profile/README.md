# Welcome to the WISPNET! <img src="https://wisp.wispnet.org/depreciated/oldlogo/WNLogo-2.png" alt="WISPNET Logo" width="50" height="50" align="left" />

## About
Started in early 2024, the **WISPNET** provides unique, simple, (and often niche), solutions to homelab users and experimenters. Consisting of two experimentation servers, one development server, and one service server, we're always growing!


## Projects

- **IOserver**: Originally a local home server, the IOserver project is a JavaScript game space, which we would love a contribution to! It was one of the first projects of the WISPNET, and was created before the WISPNET was even given a name. (Available to the public.)
- **The VX Project**: Still in the very early stages of development, the VX Project is one of the most recent projects. It is a home-made temperature sensor for outdoor research. (Not yet available to the public.)
- **The GT Project**: The GT, or get-temp Project is a `Raspberry Pi` solution to the long and complex `vcgencmd measure_temp` command, and can return the temperature value in Fahrenheit and Kelvin in addition to the default Celsius. (Not yet available to the public.) Its predecessor, the get-ftemp project, returns the value in just Farenheit. (Available to the public.)
- **wndbx**: The wndbx project, also known as WISPNET Database X, is an open-source GUI SQLite database written in Python. (Available to the public.)
- **Theme Projects**: A sort of side-project, we have been busy adding the **WISPNET** (and other) themes to the Visual Studio Code marketplace! While it is currently still in the very early phases of development, the next patch for the first version will be released shortly. It is currently available as the WISPNET Classic Theme on the VSC Marketplace. (Available to the public.)
- **The HEI Project**: The HEI project is focused on the development of the `.hei` filetype. Standing for Hex Encoded Image, an HEI file takes each pixel and assigns it a HEX value in the format of `#RRGGBBAA`. (Not yet available to the public.)
- **WISPNET WEB**: Of course, we want to make our website as aesthetic and easy to navigate as possible! We're always constantly improving it with better and better updates. Visit it at **[wispnet.org](https://wisp.wispnet.org)**!


## History
The **WISPNET** project started off as an experimental Local Area Network (LAN) created by William S. Popovici in late 2023, before it even had a name. The primary goal of the project back then was to serve as a hands-on learning experience in networking, coding, and web development (such as gaining proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The project goes back even further, though. It all started with the first experimentation server, an `OptiPlex 755` system now known as WiSP, which was revived in late 2022.
