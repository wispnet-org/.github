# Welcome to the WISPNET! <img src="https://wisp.wispnet.org/resources/logo/wispnet/oldlogo/WNLogo-2.png" alt="WISPNET Logo" width="50" height="50" align="left" />

## About
Started in early 2024, the **WISPNET** provides unique, simple, (and often niche), solutions to homelab users and creators. Consisting of two experimentation servers, one development server, and one service server, we're always growing!


## Projects

- **IOserver**: Originally a local home server, the IOserver project is a JavaScript game space, which we would love a contribution to! It was one of the first projects of the WISPNET, and was created before the WISPNET was even given a name. (Available to the public.)
- **The VX Project**: Still in the very early stages of development, the VX Project is one of the most recent projects. It is a home-made temperature sensor for outdoor research. (Not yet available to the public.)
- **Project Fiveboard**: *`REDACTED FOR SECURITY.`*
- **gettemp Project**: The gettemp Project is a `Raspberry Pi` command based on the long and complex `vcgencmd measure_temp` command, and can return the temperature value in Fahrenheit and Kelvin in addition to the default Celsius. (Not yet available to the public.) Its predecessor, the get-ftemp project, returns the value in just Farenheit. (Available to the public.)
- **wndbx**: The wndbx project is an open-source GUI SQLite database written in Python. (Available to the public.)
- **Theme Projects**: **WISPNET** (and other) themes for the Visual Studio Code marketplace.  (Not available to the public.)
- **The HEI Project**: The HEI project is focused on the development of the `.hei` filetype. Standing for Hex Encoded Image, an HEI file takes each pixel and assigns it a HEX value in the format of `#RRGGBBAA`. (Not yet available to the public.)
- **WISPNET Web**: Visit it it at ***[wispnet.org](https://wisp.wispnet.org)***!
- **ncheck**: The n-check is a CLI tool that can be configured to check different services (or technically devices) with different tags. (monocheck, duocheck, tricheck, quadcheck, quintcheck, ect.) (Not yet availible to the public.)

## History
The **WISPNET** project started off as an experimental Local Area Network (LAN) created by William S. Popovici in late 2023, before it even had a name. The primary goal of the project back then was to serve as a hands-on learning experience in networking, coding, and web development (such as gaining proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The project goes back even further, though. It all started with the first experimentation server, an `OptiPlex 755` system now known as WiSP, which was revived in late 2022.
